<h2>Data Inspection and Preparation</h2>
<p>The dataset was loaded from the file <em>"Global Marine biodiversity data.csv"</em>. Initial inspection revealed a total of 50 columns. Missing data entries were filled with "Unknown" to ensure consistency in analysis.</p>
<h2>Hypothesis Testing and Biodiversity Analysis</h2>
<p>To understand marine biodiversity trends, the following hypotheses were tested:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>H1:</strong> Marine biodiversity is significantly higher in shallow waters (0-200m) compared to deeper waters.</li>
    <li><strong>H2:</strong> There is a significant difference in marine biodiversity among different countries.</li>
    <li><strong>H3:</strong> The number of recorded marine species has significantly increased over the years.</li>
    <li><strong>H4:</strong> The basis of record (e.g., human observation, machine observation) significantly influences the recorded biodiversity data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The analysis was conducted using data on biodiversity according to depth, country of discovery, year, and basis of record. A single image was generated to summarize the findings, which includes the following graphs:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Biodiversity by Depth:</strong> Distribution of marine species across different ocean depths.</li>
    <li><strong>Biodiversity by Country:</strong> Top 10 countries with the highest recorded species diversity.</li>
    <li><strong>Biodiversity by Year:</strong> Trends in species discovery over time.</li>
    <li><strong>Biodiversity by Basis of Record:</strong> The influence of different recording methods on biodiversity data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Based on the analysis and hypothesis testing:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>H1: Accepted.</strong> The analysis supports that marine biodiversity is significantly higher in shallow waters (0-200m). This could be due to factors like light availability and nutrient concentration.</li>
    <li><strong>H2: Accepted.</strong> There is a significant difference in biodiversity across countries, with some countries exhibiting much higher species diversity. This could be due to geographical advantages, more extensive research activities, and differing conservation efforts.</li>
    <li><strong>H3: Accepted.</strong> There has been a significant increase in recorded marine species over the years. The trend reflects advancements in technology, increased research efforts, and heightened awareness of marine conservation.</li>
    <li><strong>H4: Accepted.</strong> The basis of record significantly influences biodiversity data. Human observation is predominant, but machine observation and preserved specimen records are also important, reflecting evolving research methodologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results underscore the importance of continuous and diversified efforts in marine research and conservation to preserve global marine biodiversity.</p>
