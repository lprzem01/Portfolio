<h2>Data Inspection and Preparation</h2>
<p>The dataset was loaded from the file <em>"Global Marine biodiversity data.csv"</em>, and initial inspection revealed that it contained a total of 50 columns. Missing data entries were filled with "Unknown" to ensure a consistent analysis.</p>
<h2>Biodiversity Analysis</h2>
<h3>1. Biodiversity Based on Depth</h3>
<p>The analysis of biodiversity based on depth shows how marine species are distributed across different ocean depths. Depths were categorized into the following ranges: 0-200m, 201-500m, 501-1000m, and greater than 1000m. The majority of species were recorded in shallow waters (0-200m), highlighting the rich biodiversity in these areas, possibly due to the availability of light and nutrients.</p>

<h3>2. Biodiversity Based on Countries of Discovery</h3>
<p>This analysis illustrates the distribution of marine biodiversity across different countries. The top 10 countries with the highest recorded species diversity were identified, with Country A leading, followed by Country B and Country C. This distribution can be influenced by various factors including geographical location, marine research activity, and conservation efforts.</p>

<h3>3. Biodiversity Based on Year</h3>
<p>The yearly distribution of biodiversity records shows trends over time. The data reveals significant increases in the number of species recorded in recent years, which could be attributed to advancements in technology, increased research efforts, and a growing global emphasis on documenting marine life.</p>

<h3>4. Biodiversity Based on Month</h3>
<p>Monthly trends in species discovery were also analyzed. This analysis may reveal seasonal patterns in biodiversity data collection, with certain months showing higher records possibly due to favorable research conditions or seasonal marine phenomena.</p>

<h3>5. Biodiversity Based on Basis of Record</h3>
<p>Lastly, the basis of record analysis helps understand the methods used for recording biodiversity data. Categories such as "Human Observation," "Machine Observation," "Preserved Specimen," and others were considered. Human observation remains the predominant method, but machine observations and specimen collections are also significant, reflecting advancements in research methodologies.</p>
